World Conflict
================

A risk-based strategy game originally created for [JS13k 2014](http://js13kgames.com/) by Jakub Wasilewski. This project modifies that code in order to support multiplayer online games. 

You can **[play the original version here](http://wasyl.eu/games/compact-conflict/play.html)**. The new version will be available shortly.

#### The code

The main page is `index.html`. 

If you want to build your own minified versions, `build.sh` can hook you up, but it needs the following installed:

* uglifyjs
* htmlminifier

Both are modules on **npm**.

The new version of this code is more concerned with maintainability than compactness though.

#### Thanks

Thanks go to:

* Krzysztof Kula, for recommending JS13k, and for quality feedback throughout.
* Adam Kwapi≈Ñski and Tomasz Bylina for invaluable gameplay testing sessions.
* All the kind folks at [Schibsted Tech Polska](http://schibsted.pl/) who tested the game!
